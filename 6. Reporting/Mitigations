LLMNR Poisoning
	Disable LLMNR
		In Group Policy Editor, select "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution" under Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client 
	Disable NBT-NS 
		Select "Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP" in Network Connections > Network Adapter Properties > TCP/IPv4 Properties > Advanced tab > WINS tab
	If cannot disable LLMNR/NBT-NS
		Require Network Access Control
		Require strong user passwords


SMB Relay
	Enable SMB Signing on all devices
		NOTE: can cause performance issues with file copies
	Disable NTLM authentication on network
		NOTE: If Kerberos fails, Windows will default to NTLM
	Account Tiering
	Local Admin Restriction


IPv6 Poisoning
	NOTE: disabling IPv6 may have unwanted side effects

	If not using IPv6 internally
		Change Windows Firewall settings via Group Policy from ALLOW to BLOCK:
			(Inbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPv6-In)
			(Inbound) Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)
			(Outbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPv6-Out)
	If not using WPAD internally
		Disable WinHttpAutoProxySvc service via Group Policy

	Enable LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding

	Consider moving Administrative users to the Protected Users group or marking them as "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" - prevents impersonation via delegation

	Implement Secure IPv6 Policies

		Require defend/protect/filter ICMPv6 and Multicast
			filter out ICMPv6 message types 5-127,138-255 
			filter ICMPv6 message types 133,134
				only from trusted routers
		Require security controls on FF03 (realm), FF04 (admin), FF05 (site), FF06 (organisation) link local multicast addresses

		Address filtering
			implement anti-spoofing perimeter ACl
				no packet with source address of your network to enter
				no packet with destination address of your netwwork to leave
		Perimteter Filtering
			Transit Traffic
				Start with DENY ALL
				Allow:
					ICMPv6 1: Destination unreachable
						filter selectively - eg. allow 4 port unreachable
					ICMPv6 2: Packet too large
					ICMPv6 3: Code 0 only (TTL hop expired)
					ICMPv6 4: Code 0/1 only (bad headers)
					128/129 optional - echo request/reply
					allow 144-147 only if network is "mobility enabled"
					151-153 optional - only if participating in global multicast
				DROP 137 (redirect) - drop at perimeter
			Non-Transit
				Start with DENY ALL
				Follow Transit policy
				Allow 133-136, 141-142
		Multicast Filtering
			distinguish perimeter traffic from internal
			ND and RD has to function internally - should not transit perimeter
			end hosts should not be permitted to advertise as routers
			end hosts should not be gratuitously responding to NS
			most should not participate in global/inter-domain multicast
				any packet with multicast source drop at perim
				reserved and unused multicast destination drop at perim
				most others drop at perim
		Protocol Normalisation
			enforce extension header rules
				each header should no appear more than once 
					except destination options header
				0 (hop-by-hop options) should be first
				60 (dest options) should be at end (twice at most)
				44 (fragment) should not appear more than once
			filter specific types and subtypes within header
				might be subject of DoS attack - work the filtering too hard
			drop any with headers with padding not at 0's
				hop-by-hop and destination options can include padding to 8-octet boundaries - covert data exfil
			route options header (43) 
				similar to IPv4 strict-source/loose-source routing
					danger: Send me all the things!
				must not contain source route type (0)
					deprecated - can cause packet oscillation - DoS
			drop reserved, undefined, etc
		Address Privacy
			EUI-64 
				MAC address in host portion 
				company devices likely all/most from same manufacturer - 
				leaves only 24-bit search space for link-local scope
				recommend disable EUI-64
					link local and SLAAC addresses will be random
			ping6 -i eth1 ff02::1   
				link local multicast reveals all hosts in local scope
			Endpoint route table
				don't allow endpoints to advertise routes
				block Router Advertisement from endpoints
			NAT66 - don't use unless you need addressing independence
				see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6296
		don't trunk VLANs everywhere - multicast switch CAM table DoS


Pass Attacks (Pass the Password/Hash)
	Limit or eliminate account re-use
		avoid re-using local admin password
		disable Guest and Administrator accounts
		limit who is a local administrator (least privilege)
	Use strong passwords
	Privilege Access Management
		check out/in sensitive accounts only when needed
		automatically rotate passwords on check out/in


Token Impersonation
	Limit user/group token creation permissions
	Account tiering
	Local admin restriction


Kerberoasting
	Strong passwords
	Least privilege
